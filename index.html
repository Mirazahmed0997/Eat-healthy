                    The story goes that my Irish ancestors brought this recipe along when they immigrated to the U.S. It
                    takes nearly a week, start to finish, but that gives the meat time to become really tenderized and
                    build
                    up layers of flavor. —Mary Shenk, Dekalb, Illinois
